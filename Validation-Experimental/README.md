# Numerical and Experimental Analysis of Wave Generation in a Hydrodynamic Wave Basin
## Abstract
Wave basins are widely used for hydrodynamic testing, and accurate calibration of wavemakers under varying marine conditions is critical. This study compares Boundary Element Method (BEM) simulations (based on linear wave theory) with analytical and experimental results to optimize wavemaker efficiency.

## Key Findings:
Linear wave theory (assuming incompressible, irrotational flow) effectively simulates small-amplitude waves.
Numerical solutions predict wave heights 5.6% lower than analytical solutions, aligning with prior research.
Experimental validation shows acceptable agreement with numerical results.

## Experimental Setup
The hydrodynamic wave basin (Table 1) features a hinged wavemaker at one end and absorbing porous beaches at the other (Fig. 1).

Length	11.0
Width	3.0
Depth	3.5
Water Height	1.66

### Wavemaker Mechanism:
An electric motor drives the wavemaker via an adjustable arm.
Stroke length (S) and motor speed (N) are controllable.
Wave height (H) and period (T) are measured manually (graduated scale and timer).
 	  	 
## Results: Numerical vs. Analytical vs. Experimental
Tests covered 14 stroke lengths (6–29 cm) and motor speeds (10–50 RPM). Key metrics:
### Error Definitions:
1-Wave height error:
`E_H = (H_numerical - H_experimental) / H_experimental × 100%`
