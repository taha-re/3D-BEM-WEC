# Comparison of Experimental and Theoretical Results for Surface Wave Generation Using a Flap-type Wavemaker
This repository presents a comparative analysis between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for surface waves generated by a flap-type wavemaker. The investigation evaluates the accuracy of linear wave theory and numerical modeling in simulating wave characteristics under controlled laboratory conditions.

## Key Findings:
### Wave Height Prediction:
The numerical solution (Boundary Element Method) consistently underpredicts wave heights by an average of 5.6% compared to analytical results.
Experimental wave heights generally fall between numerical and analytical predictions, confirming the validity of linear theory for small to moderate wave slopes (ka < 0.048).

### Motor Speed & Stroke Length Effects:
For a fixed motor speed, wave height increases with larger stroke lengths.  
At a constant stroke, wave height grows with higher motor speedsâ€”a trend observed in both experiments and simulations.

## Discrepancies & Limitations:
Primary error sources include:  
1. Experimental measurement uncertainties
2. Minor fluid leakage around the wavemaker
3. Imperfect wave absorption at the beach
4. Scale effects when wavelengths approach flume dimensions
5. Nonlinear effects (ignored in linear theory) become significant for steeper waves (ka > 0.048), contributing to deviations.

## Conclusion:
While linear wave theory provides a robust framework for wave prediction, its accuracy diminishes for:
1. Large strokes (>29 cm)
2. High motor speeds (>50 RPM)
3. Steep waves (ka > 0.048)

The flap-type wavemaker demonstrates reliable performance for small to moderate waves, but future work should incorporate nonlinear corrections to improve agreement in extreme conditions.

## Suggested Improvements for Follow-up Studies:
1. Enhanced sealing to reduce leakage  
2. Active wave absorption systems to minimize reflections
3. Higher-resolution sensors for precise wave measurement
4. CFD validation to capture nonlinearities
