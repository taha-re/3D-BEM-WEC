# Floating Body Motion in the Time Domain  
<div align="justify">
The hydrodynamic reaction forces and moments resulting from the time-varying motions of floating bodies can be described using Cummins' traditional formulation [1]. As shown by Ogilvie [2], complex potential problems can be solved using frequency-dependent potential coefficients. Below, the principles of this approach are examined for a single-degree-of-freedom problem.

## The Cummins Equation  
<div align="justify">
The floating body is assumed to be a linear system with a translational velocity as the input and the surrounding water’s reaction force as the output. It is also assumed that the body is at rest at time t=t0. Over a short time interval Δt, the body undergoes a sudden displacement Δx at a constant velocity ΔV, such that:
